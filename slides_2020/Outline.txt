1. process of coding lab / camp

# Outline

Lesson 1: Brains
Workshop: Installing R, Rstudio and the tidyverse (new, but minimal)
- Why learn to code?
- Sequence of R at Harris
- The team
- Computational reasoning / getting help (lyl1)

*break* Bones
# install.packages(), library()
- install (new)
- packages and `tidyverse` (from lyl2)

*break* Heart
- Repeat Computational reasoning / getting help (lyl1)
- Example of using R

Lesson 2: Loading data and basic manipulations (extending scl-lesson 2)
Workshop: Reading files (new)
# select(), mutate(), filter(), arrange()
- manipulating data with `dplyr`

 # read_*()
 - reading data files into R
 - detour: directory structures



Lesson 3: Data types, vectors, vectorized functions and base R (scl-lesson 1)
 # sum(), mean(), rep(), paste0(), [,], $, binary operators
 Workshop (scl-workshop 1)
 - Binary operators pt 1 + Variable assignment
 - Types + Binary operators pt 2
 - Data structures (Vectors, Tibbles)
 - detour: manipulating data with `baseR`

Lesson 4: Summarizing and analyzing data (extending scl-lesson 2)
Workshop (scl-workshop 2)
# group_by(), summarize()
group_by and summarize

Lesson 5:
Workshop (scl-workshop 3)
Conditional statements (scl-lesson 3)
# if(){}, ifelse(), boolean operators


Lesson 6: Visualizing data (new)
# ggplot(), geom_point(), geom_line(), geom_col(), grammar of graphics
Workshop: Work on final project


Extras:
# *_join(), spread(), gather()
# p/d/r/q functions for distributions






# Notes

Day one:

Introduction to R

Why R?

- R is awesome ... (someone else has a list of why)


Do example of data analysis with interesting graph.

By the end of





What will we learn -- how does this fit into curriculum

- We are going to learn basic data manipulation
    - how to read data into R
    - how to manipulate the data to fit our analytical needs
    - how to make basic visualizations

- In the fall, we'll include some more core programming skills
    - loops and functions

- In statistics courses, you'll develop content specific skills
- etc


Introduce self and TAs

Expectations
- Come to lab and work hard for the 60 mins
- Get supported and be supportive --> engage with piazza e.g
- Complete a data project -- make a data visualization of topic you care about (or )


The lab courses are organized in the following way:
    - video lecture
    - labs --> work on developing R skills in small groups on zoom with peer support and TAs
    (more info ... )

Data project
    - Ideally you pick data on a topic you care about
        - we have a long list of data sets and you're free to find your own.
    - Load the data
    - make a graph
    - manipulate the data, make another graph.

    We will give feedback on these! and then suggest whether or not you should
    take the 5 week version or the accelerated version.
