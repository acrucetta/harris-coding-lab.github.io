## What's the Deal with Fall Coding Lab?

Two tracks:

**Accelerated**: 2 lessons

- 2 lessons covering loops and functions.
- No final project (you already did it).

**Not accelerated**: 5 lessons. 

- 3 lessons review summer camp material. 
- 2 lessons covering loops and functions.
- Final project:
  - Find a data set that speaks to you.
  - Try to uncover something interesting. Graph it and tab it. 
  - We'll give you feedback.
  
## Logistics for Both Tracks

- Instructors Ari and Terence + wonderful TAs.
- 80 minutes per week: brief review and Q&A, then work in groups.
- Not graded.
- Access to TAs for coding specific problems throughout the quarter.
  - TA office hours 30 minutes before and after lecture time.
- [Github website](https://harris-coding-lab.github.io) with all material.
  - We'll post solutions (eventually).
- Use Piazza for questions.
  - Rules of engagement: coding questions only, no Stats homework!
  - How to ask a good question?

## Poll: How much coding experience do you have? 

  - First timer.
  - Beginner.
  - Intermediate.
  - Proficient.

# Class 1: Why R? & Vectors

## Key Points: R Basics

- Rstudio has a console to access R and a text editor to write code for reproducible projects.
  - Analogy: R is to RStudio as Tony Stark is to Iron Man's suit.
- R extensible through packages.
  -  use `install.packages("")` once and then `library()` each session.
- Use `<-` to assign *any* object to a name.
- Functions take inputs and return outputs.
  - Input "understood" based on position or name.
  - Find out more about functions with `?` (e.g. `?filter`).
  
## Questions

- Any questions on this? Feel free to ask on chat.

## Key points: Vectors 

- Vectors are the fundamental way to store data in R.
- We can operate on vectors element-by-element without loops.
  - `dplyr` verbs rely on this!
- We introduced built-in functions to build vectors and do operations on vectors. 
- `NA`s are sticky!

## Key points: Data Types and Coercion

- (Atomic) Vectors have a single data type.
  - Most often: `logical`, `integer`, `double`, or `character`.
- Certain operations expect a certain data type and R will try to coerce the data if it can.
- Usually, simpler types can be coerced to more complex types. 
  - `logical < integer < double < character`.
  - Example on slides: `paste0(1L, "ing")`.
- Caution! Coercion can lead to unexpected behavior such as making `NA`s.

## One More Thing

Logicals are coercible to numeric or character. This is very useful!

Determine the rule for how R treats `TRUE` and `FALSE` in math.

```{r}
TRUE + 4
```

```{r}
FALSE + 4
```

# Warm up & Lab 1

## Warm up

- Solve the questions at the beginning of the lab in small (random) groups.

## Lab 1

- Two "types" of breakout room:
  - Work along: larger group with more guidance from a TA. 
  - Small groups: 4 people, TAs will come in and out to answer questions. Use the help button!
- Add "(work along)" or "(small group)" to your Zoom name so we can sort you.
- Get as far as you can, then finish it up after class.
- Before you leave, fill out the exit poll.

## Lab 1: Exit poll

- What does `hist()` return?
  - A histogram plot of the data you give it.
  - A history of the commands you've run.

# Class 2: Reading files and `dplyr'

## Course logistics:

- When should we start working on the final project?
    - Start looking for a dataset now. 
    - Write code to read it into R and start investigating with `dplyr` verbs.
      - Ask simple questions that can be addressed with your current tools.

## Key points: Reading files

- Tabular data is stored in a lot of different formats.
  - e.g. `.csv`, `.xlsx`, `.dta`
- Read tabular data of a given type with the proper function.
  - e.g. for `csv`s we have `read_csv()`
  - If you get a new type, Google "How to read xxx files into R tidyverse".
- We need to be aware of the file path and can `setwd()`.
- We know there are useful tools built into the `read_xxx()` functions.
  - Though we just scratched the surface.
  
## Key points: Manipulating data with `dplyr()`

- Choose columns with `select()`.
- Choose rows based on a match criteria with `filter()`.
  - We were introduced to comparison operators like  `==` and `%in%`.
- Make new columns with `mutate()`.
- Sort data with `arrange()` and `arrange(desc())` or `arrange(-x)`.
- Create summary statistics with `summarize()`.

## Key points: Grouped analysis with `group_by()`

- *Groups* are a set of rows that belong together.
  - `group_by()` adds information about groups without changing the "data".
- Use `group_by()` with `summarize()` to create summary data at group-level.
  - Use with functions that *reduce* data from a vector to a single value per group.
  - Expected output: a table with one row per group and one column per summary statistic and one column per grouping column.
- We can also use `group_by` to do grouped analysis with:
  - `mutate` with window functions or to add a summary stat as column for further analysis.
  - It also can impact `arrange` and `filter`.
  
# Warm up & Lab 2

## Warm up & Lab 2

- Solve the questions at the beginning of the lab in small (random) groups.
- After: add "(small group)" in front of your name if you want to work in one,
if you want to work along just stay in the main room.

- Exit poll:

1. What `dplyr` command allows you to create or modify variables?
2. What `dplyr` command allows you to sort your data?

**Accelerated**: 2 lessons

- 2 lessons covering loops and functions.
- No final project (you already did it).
- Occurs every other week.
  - Ideally the sections are balanced. 

**Not accelerated**: 5 lessons. 

- 3 lessons review summer camp material. 
- 2 lessons covering loops and functions.
- Final project:
  - Find a data set that speaks to you.
  - Try to uncover something interesting. Graph it and tab it. 
  - We'll give you feedback.

## Today

- Review what functions are
- Do a warm-up
- Provide background for the lab
- Do the lab

##  Functions

What are some of the key take aways you learned about functions from the video?

```{r}
do_monte_carlo <- function(N, true_mean, B, alpha){
  sample_statistics <- monte_carlo_samples(N, true_mean, B)
  z_scores <- get_zscores(sample_statistics$mean, 
                          true_mean, 
                          sample_statistics$sd, 
                          N)
  test_significance(z_scores, alpha) %>% mean()
}

```


## Key points: Functions

- Write functions when you want o use a set of operations repeatedly
    - Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)
- Functions consist of arguments and a body and are usually assigned to a name.
    - The arguments are things that you want to change in the code
    - The body is what you would be repeating if you wrote sloppy code
- Functions are for humans
    - pick names for the function and arguments that are clear and consistent
- Debug your code as much as you can as you write it.
    - if you want to use your code with `mutate()` test the code with vectors


## Warm up

- Solve the questions at the beginning of the lab in small (random) groups.


## Background for the lab

```{r norm, echo = FALSE, cache = TRUE}

sample <- rnorm(1e5)
pdf_data <- with(density(sample, n = 1000), tibble(x, y))

cutoff <- 1.96
```


## Concepts: `r/q/p/d` functions

R has built-in functions for working with distributions.

| | example | what it does? |
| -- | -- | -- | 
| r | `rnorm(n)` | generates a random sample of size n |
| p | `pnorm(q)` | returns CDF value at q | 
| q | `qnorm(p)` | returns inverse CDF (the quantile) for a given probability |
| d | `dnorm(x)` | returns pdf value at x |  


We should already be familiar with `r` functions like `rnorm()` and `runif()`.

- These concepts will be taught in stats. We don't expect you to learn them here. We can help you reason through the material enough to do the coding.

## What are `p` and `q`?

```{r, echo = FALSE, cache = TRUE}

pdf_data  %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y)) + 
  geom_line() +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymax = y), ymin=0, fill = "red", alpha = .5, 
              data = pdf_data %>% filter(x < cutoff)) + 
  labs(x = "z score",  y = "likelihood",  title = "pdf of standard normal", subtitle = "area under curve is the probability of being less than a cutoff") + 
  annotate("text", x = 0, y = .1, label = "P(x < 1.96) = .975") + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(-1.96,  0, 1.96)) +
  theme_minimal() 
```


## What are `p` and `q`?

```{r cdf, echo = FALSE}
cdf <- ecdf(sample)

cdf_data <- 
  tibble(x = sample,
         y = cdf(sample))

cdf_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y)) + 
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = "z score (aka q)", title = "cdf of standard normal (the integeral of the pdf)", y = "F(z) = Pr(x < z)  aka p") + 
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = pnorm(cutoff)), linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = cutoff), linetype = "dashed") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(-1.96,  0, 1.96)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(0, .25, .5, .75, .975, 1)) + 
  annotate("text", x = -2, y = .9, label = "plug .975 in qnorm()\nto learn cutoff" ) +
  annotate("text", x = 1, y = .2, label = "plug 1.96 in pnorm()\nto learn P(x < q)" ) +
  theme_minimal() 
```

## What are `p` and `q`?

**`pnorm`** returns the probability we observe a value less than or equal to some value `q`.

```{r}
pnorm(1.96)
pnorm(0)
```

**`qnorm`** returns the inverse of `pnorm`. Plug in the probability and get the cutoff.

```{r}
qnorm(.975)
qnorm(.5)
```


## Monte Carlo experiments

Monte Carlo is a world gambling hub. 

- Gamblers know that roulette wheels are not made perfectly. 

- If you watch the wheel long enough and take notes you can figure out the emprical probability

![](roullette.jpg)


## Monte Carlo experiments

Statisticians use the same idea. 

- If we're not sure how to calculate something exactly, we can simulate it and get the result.

- Often used for difficult to compute integrals.

## An example

In real life experiements we usually have one sample.

```{r sim_1}
# Setting a seed ensures replicability
set.seed(4)

# we set our parameters
true_mean <- 0.5
N <- 30

# We simulate and observe outcomes
simulated_data <- rnorm(N, mean = true_mean)
obs_mean <- mean(simulated_data)
obs_mean
```

## Put that number in perspective with a z score

```{r}
obs_sd <- sd(simulated_data)
zscore <- (obs_mean - true_mean) / (obs_sd / sqrt(N))
zscore
```

```{r pvalue}
1 - pnorm(zscore)
```


## Our monte carlo experiment

Show that the sample mean from a sample drawn from a normal distribution falls outside the 95 percent confidence region 5 percent of the time.

```{r, echo = FALSE, cache = TRUE}

pdf_data  %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y)) + 
  geom_line() +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymax = y), ymin=0, fill = "red", alpha = .5, 
              data = pdf_data %>% filter(abs(x) < cutoff)) + 
  labs(x = "z score", y = "likelihood") + 
  annotate("text", x = 0, y = .1, label = "P(-1.96 < x < 1.96) = .95") + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(-1.96,  0, 1.96)) +
  theme_minimal() 
```

## How to do a Monte Carlo Simulation

1. Generate random samples of data using a known process (e.g. `rnorm()`).
2. Make calculations based on the random sample.
3. Aggregate the results.

```{r}
do_monte_carlo <- function(N, true_mean, B, alpha){
  sample_statistics <- make_mc_samples(N, true_mean, B)
  z_scores <- get_zscores(sample_statistics$mean, true_mean, sample_statistics$sd, N)
  test_significance(z_scores, alpha) %>% mean()
}

```
