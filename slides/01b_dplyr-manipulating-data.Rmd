## Data manipulation with `dplyr`

Once you have data in R, you'll want to explore it. 

The `tidyverse` package `dplyr` provides a toolkit for data manipulation.

We will cover:

- `select()` to pick columns
- `arrange()` to order the data
- `mutate()` to create new columns
- `filter()` to get rows that meet a criteria
- `summarize()` to summarize data


## selecting columns with `select()` {.build}

![](images/02_select.png){#id .class width=80% height=80%}


## selecting columns with `select()` {.build}
<!-- Unclear how much justice we can do here with the time available. Probably could do a full class on these-->
Use case: You want to present a subset of your columns

```{r}
select(texas_housing_data, city, date, sales, listings)
```

## selecting columns with `select()`

Use case: You want to present a subset of your columns

```{r, eval = FALSE}
select(texas_housing_data, -c(city, date, sales, listings))
```

The `-` says to exclude the columns listed in the vector.


## selecting columns with `select()`, helpers {.build}

Use case: You want to reorder your columns

```{r}
select(texas_housing_data, city, date, 
       sales, listings, everything())
```


Notice we used a "select_helpers" function `everything()`. There are several useful functions, see `?tidyselect::select_helpers`. (For more information see r4ds chapter 5.4)

## sort rows with `arrange()`

![](images/02_arrange.png){#id .class width=80% height=80%}

## sort rows with `arrange()`

```{r}
arrange(texas_housing_data, year)
```

## sort rows with `arrange()`

To change the order of use `desc()`
```{r}
arrange(texas_housing_data, desc(year))
```

## Introducing the pipe operator

![](images/magritte.jpg)

## Interlude: Ceci est une `%>%` {.build}

The pipe `%>%` operator takes the left-hand side and makes it *input* in the right-hand side.

- by default, the left-hand side is the *first argument* of the right-hand side function.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# a tibble is the first argument
select(texas_housing_data, city, year, sales, volume) 

texas_housing_data %>% 
  select(city, year, sales, volume)
```

## Ceci est une `%>%` {.build}

We can chain together tidyverse functions to avoid making so many intermediate data frames!
```{r}
texas_housing_data %>%
  select(city, year, month, median) %>%
  arrange(desc(median))
```



## creating columns with `mutate()` {.build}

![](images/02_mutate.png){#id .class width=80% height=80%}


## creating columns with `mutate()` {.build}

```{r}
texas_housing_data %>%
  mutate(mean_price = volume / sales) %>%
  select(city, year, month,  mean_price, sales, volume)
```

## Binary operators: Math in R

R is a calculator! We can do math with numbers, using the following symbols:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
4 + 4
4 - 4
4 * 4
4 / 4
4 ^ 4
5 %% 4  # gives the remainder after dividing
```


## creating columns with `mutate()` {.build}

When we mutate, you can create new columns.

- On the right side of the equal sign, you have the name of a new column. 
- On the left side, you have code that creates a new column (using vector operations)^[more on vectors in the next lesson]

```{r}
texas_housing_data %>%
  mutate(mean_price = volume / sales) %>%
  select(city, year, month,  mean_price, sales, volume)
```
  


## creating columns with `mutate()` {.build}

You can create multiple columns at a single time and even use information from a newly created column as input.


```{r}
texas_housing_data %>%
  mutate(mean_price = volume / sales,
         sqrt_mean_price = sqrt(mean_price)) %>%
  select(city, year, month,  mean_price, sales, volume)
```
  


## choose rows that match a condition with `filter()`

![](images/02_filter.png){#id .class width=80% height=80%}

## choose rows that match a condition with `filter()`

Get all the data from 2013
```{r}
filter(texas_housing_data, year == 2013)
```

## Relational operators return TRUE or FALSE
Before moving forward with `filter()`, we need to know about relational operators and logical operators

| Operator | Name |
|:---------:|:---:|
| < | less than |
| > | greater than |
| <= | less than or equal to |
| >= | greater than or equal to |
| == | equal to |
| != | not equal to |
| %in% | matches something in |

## Relational operators in practice

```{r}
4 < 4
4 >= 4
4 == 4
4 != 4
4 %in% c(1, 2, 3)
```

## logical operators combine TRUEs and FALSEs logically

| Operator | Name |
|:---------:|:---:|
| ! | not |
| & | and |
| `|` | or |

```{r}
# not true
! TRUE

# are both x & y TRUE?
TRUE  &  FALSE

# is either x | y TRUE?
TRUE | FALSE
```

##  What do the following return? 

Logical operators team up with relational operators.

 - First, evaluate the relational operator 
 - Then, care out the logic.
 
```{r, eval = FALSE}
! (4 > 3) # ! TRUE
(5 > 1) & (5 > 2) # TRUE & TRUE
(4 > 10) | (20 > 3) # FALSE | TRUE
```

This is hard to wrap your head around. We'll have plenty of practice!

## choose rows that match a condition with `filter()`

Get all the data from 2013 for Houston. 

  - in `filter()` additional match criteria are treated like `and`
 
```{r}
texas_housing_data %>%
  filter(year == 2013, 
         city == "Houston")
```


## choose rows that match a condition with `filter()`

Get all the data from 2013 for Houston or Austin

  - in `filter()` additional match criteria are treated like `and`
  - we get nothing returned here, because no observation is in Houston AND in Austin.
 
```{r}
texas_housing_data %>%
  filter(year == 2013, 
         city == "Houston", city == "Austin")
```


## choose rows that match a condition with `filter()`

Get all the data from after than 2013 for Houston OR Austin
```{r}
texas_housing_data %>% 
  filter(year > 2013, 
         city == "Houston" | city == "Austin")
```


## choose rows that match a condition with `filter()`

Get all the data from after than 2013 for Houston  Galveston
```{r}
texas_housing_data %>%
  filter(year > 2013, 
         city %in% c("Houston", "Dallas", "Austin"))
```

## summarize data with `summarize()`

![](images/02_summarize.png)

## summarize data with `summarize()`

Calculate total volume of sales in Texas from 2014. 

```{r}
texas_housing_data %>%
  filter(year == 2014) %>%
  summarize(total_volume = sum(volume))
```

## summarize data with `summarize()`

Calculate the mean and median number of sales in Texas's three largest cities. 

```{r}
texas_housing_data %>%
  filter(city %in% 
           c("Houston", "Dallas", "San Antonio")) %>% 
  summarize(median_n_sales = median(sales),
            mean_n_sales = mean(sales))
```
## summarize data with `summarize()`

There are many useful functions that go with summarize. Try `?summarize` for more.

```{r}
texas_housing_data %>%
  filter(city %in% 
           c("Houston", "Dallas", "San Antonio")) %>% 
  summarize(n_obs = n(),
            n_cities = n_distinct(city))
```

## summarize data with `summarize()`

If you try to make a summarize statistic that does not collapse the data to a single value (per group), you'll get an error like so: 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
texas_housing_data %>%
  filter(city %in% 
           c("Houston", "Dallas", "San Antonio")) %>% 
  summarize(mean_price = volume / sales)

Error: Column `mean_price` must be length 1 (a summary value), not 561
```

Get number of observations

## piping `dplyr` verbs together

`dplyr`verbs can be piped together in any order you want, although different orders can give you different results, so be careful!

```{r}

texas_housing_data %>%
  select(city, year, month, sales, volume) %>%
  mutate(log_mean_price = log(volume / sales)) %>%
  filter(year == 2013) %>%
  summarize(log_mean_price_2013 = mean(log_mean_price))
  
# Won't give you the same result as 
# texas_housing_data %>%
 #  select(city, year, month, sales, volume) %>%
 #  mutate(log_mean_price = log(volume / sales)) %>%
 #  summarize(log_mean_price = mean(log_mean_price)) %>%
 #  filter(year == 2013)
  
# Actually this code will give you an error, try it!

```
