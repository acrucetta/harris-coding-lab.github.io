Once you have data in R, you'll want to explore it.
We're going to use the tidy verse package DPLYR that provides
the gives you access to the most useful functions in R! 

When I am analyzing data I use these 5 functions for 80 percent

1. process of coding lab / camp

# Outline

Lesson 1: Brains
Workshop: Installing R, Rstudio and the tidyverse (new, but minimal)
- Why learn to code?
- Sequence of R at Harris
- The team
- Computational reasoning / getting help (lyl1)

*break* Bones
# install.packages(), library()
- install (new)
- packages and `tidyverse` (from lyl2)

*break* Heart
- Repeat Computational reasoning / getting help (lyl1)
- Example of using R

Lesson 2: Loading data and basic manipulations (extending scl-lesson 2)
Workshop: Reading files (new)\ 
# Operators and assignment
# select(), mutate(), filter(), arrange(),  binary operators
- manipulating data with `dplyr`

 # read_*()
 - reading data files into R
 - detour: directory structures



Lesson 3: Data types, vectors, vectorized functions and base R (scl-lesson 1)

FOR CLASS: Finding the sum of 1/2^n; 
	   Automatic type coercion (e.g. TRUE + TRUE = 2, "four" < 4)

 # sum(), mean(), rep(), paste0(), [,], $, as.xxx(), Workshop (scl-workshop 1)
 - Data Types 
 - Data structures (Vectors, Tibbles)
 - detour: manipulating data with `baseR`


Note: add info about Dates and Factors (?)

Lesson 4: Summarizing and analyzing data (extending scl-lesson 2)
Workshop (scl-workshop 2)
# group_by(), summarize()
group_by and summarize

Lesson 5:
Workshop (scl-workshop 3)
Conditional statements (scl-lesson 3)
# if(){}, ifelse(), boolean operators


Lesson 6: Visualizing data (new)
# ggplot(), geom_point(), geom_line(), geom_col(), grammar of graphics
Workshop: Work on final project


Extras:
# *_join(), spread(), gather()
# p/d/r/q functions for distributions

# Notes

Day one:

Introduction to R

Why R?

- R is awesome ... (someone else has a list of why)


Do example of data analysis with interesting graph.

By the end of





What will we learn -- how does this fit into curriculum

- We are going to learn basic data manipulation
    - how to read data into R
    - how to manipulate the data to fit our analytical needs
    - how to make basic visualizations

- In the fall, we'll include some more core programming skills
    - loops and functions

- In statistics courses, you'll develop content specific skills
- etc


Introduce self and TAs

Expectations
- Come to lab and work hard for the 60 mins
- Get supported and be supportive --> engage with piazza e.g
- Complete a data project -- make a data visualization of topic you care about (or )


The lab courses are organized in the following way:
    - video lecture
    - labs --> work on developing R skills in small groups on zoom with peer support and TAs
    (more info ... )

Data project
    - Ideally you pick data on a topic you care about
        - we have a long list of data sets and you're free to find your own.
    - Load the data
    - make a graph
    - manipulate the data, make another graph.

    We will give feedback on these! and then suggest whether or not you should
    take the 5 week version or the accelerated version.
