## Review: Iteration with for loops

Last time, we showed how to use for loops to repeat ourselves.

```{r}
mean(rnorm(1))
mean(rnorm(2))
mean(rnorm(3))
```


## Review: Iteration with for loops

Becomes:

```{r}
sample_sizes <- 1:30
means <- numeric(length(sample_sizes))

for (i in seq_along(sample_sizes)) {
  means[i] = mean(rnorm(i))
}

means
```

## Another way to repeat ourselves: functions!

R is a **functional programming language**, so we largely prefer functions as the way to do things.

```{r}
calculate_sample_mean <- function(sample_size) {
  sample_mean <- mean(rnorm(sample_size))
  
  sample_mean
}

calculate_sample_mean(1)
```

Let's break it down...

## Functions

The general structure of a function is as follows:

```{r eval=FALSE}
function_name <- function(arguments) {
  do_this(arguments)
}
```

## Functions

There are three main parts to a function:

1. Function name
2. Function arguments
3. Function body

```{r eval=FALSE}
function_name <- function(arguments) {
  do_this(arguments)
}
```

## Simple example: printing output

```{r}
print("Number 1!")
print("Number 2!")
print("Number 3!")
# and so on...
print("Number 10!")
```

## Simple example: printing output

Set up the body of the function:

```{r eval=FALSE}
name <- function() {
  
}
```

You can do this with a code snippet in RStudio (start typing "fun", then press Tab!)

## Simple example: printing output

Come up with a short, descriptive name:

```{r eval=FALSE}
shout_number <- function() {
  
}
```

We recommend verb_thing(), so `calculate_size()` or `compare_prices()` as vs. `fun1()`, `calc()`.

## Simple example: printing output

Decide what the input to the function will be:

```{r eval=FALSE}
shout_number <- function(number) {
  
}
```

## Simple example: printing output

Do something to that input:

```{r}
shout_number <- function(number) {
  paste0("Number ", number, "!")
}
```

Note that we don't need to explicitly call `return()` - the last line of the code will be the value returned by the function.

## Simple example: printing output

Test it out:

```{r}
shout_number <- function(number) {
  paste0("Number ", number, "!")
}

shout_number(1)
```

Question: does `number` exist in my R environment after I run this function? Why or why not?

## Second example: calculating the mean of a sample

```{r}
calculate_sample_mean <- function(sample_size) {
  sample_mean <- mean(rnorm(sample_size))
  
  sample_mean
}

calculate_sample_mean(1)
```

## Function defaults

We can set values to be defaults, but the user can change them. 

Our function from before:

```{r}
calculate_sample_mean <- function(sample_size) {
  sample_mean <- mean(rnorm(sample_size))
  
  sample_mean
}
```

## Function defaults

We can set values to be defaults, but the user can change them. 

We add more arguments, and set default values for them:

```{r}
calculate_sample_mean <- function(sample_size, 
                                  our_mean = 0, 
                                  our_sd = 1) {
  sample_mean <- mean(rnorm(sample_size, 
                            mean = our_mean, 
                            sd = our_sd))
  
  sample_mean
}
```

## Function defaults

```{r}
calculate_sample_mean(10, our_mean = 6, our_sd = 2)
calculate_sample_mean(our_sd = 2, sample_size = 9)
```

This won't work:

```{r eval=FALSE}
calculate_sample_mean(our_mean = 5)
```

```
Error in rnorm(sample_size, mean = our_mean, sd = our_sd) : 
  argument "sample_size" is missing, with no default
```

## Functions in functions

We can pass functions as arguments to other functions. Before:

```{r}
calculate_sample_mean <- function(sample_size, 
                                  our_mean = 0, 
                                  our_sd = 1) {
  sample_mean <- mean(rnorm(sample_size, 
                            mean = our_mean, 
                            sd = our_sd))
  
  sample_mean
}
```


## Functions in functions

We can pass functions as arguments to other functions. After:

```{r}
summarize_sample <- function(sample_size, 
                                  our_mean = 0, 
                                  our_sd = 1,
                                  summary_fxn = mean) {
  summary_stat <- summary_fxn(rnorm(sample_size, 
                            mean = our_mean, 
                            sd = our_sd))
  
  summary_stat
}
```

## Functions in functions

```{r}
calculate_sample_mean(sample_size = 10, 
                      our_mean = 0, 
                      our_sd = 1)
summarize_sample(sample_size = 10, 
                our_mean = 0, 
                our_sd = 1, 
                summary_fxn = max)
```

`calculate_sample_mean()` is now probably the wrong name for this function - we should call it `summarize_sample()` or something like that.

## Detour: probability distributions

R has built-in functions for working with distributions.

| | example | what it does? |
| -- | -- | -- | 
| d | `dnorm(x)` | returns pdf value at x |  
| p | `pnorm(x)` | returns CDF value at x | 
| q | `qnorm(q)` | returns inverse CDF for a given quantile |
| r | `rnorm(n)` | generates a random sample of size n |

Probability distributions you are familiar with are likely built-in to R.

For example, the binomial distribution has `dbinom()`, `pbinom()`, `qbinom()`, `rbinom()`. The t distribution has `dt()`, `pt()`, `qt()`, `rt()`, etc.


Read [this tutorial](https://thomasleeper.com/Rcourse/Tutorials/distributions.html) for more information.

## Detour: probability distributions

- `dnorm()`: density function, the PDF evaluated at X. 

```{r}
dnorm(0)
dnorm(1)
dnorm(-1)
```

## Detour: probability distributions

- `pnorm()`: cumulative distribution function, the CDF evaluated at X.

```{r}
pnorm(0)
pnorm(1)
pnorm(-1)
```

## Detour: probability distributions

- `qnorm()`: quantile function, the inverse CDF evaluated at a quantile.

```{r}
qnorm(c(0.05, 0.95))
qnorm(c(0.025, 0.975))
pnorm(qnorm(c(0.025, 0.975)))
```

## Detour: probability distributions

- `rnorm()`: random sampling

```{r}
rnorm(1)
rnorm(5)
rnorm(30)
```


## Best practices for functions

1. Keep your functions simple and short
2. Name functions well (verb_thing() is generally good), and document what they take as input and output
3. Check and debug your functions as you write them, not at the very end

## Detour: Monte Carlo Simulations

## Appendix: map() family of functions

Functions are powerful when `map()`ed to lists:

```{r}
shout_number <- function(number) {
  paste0("Number ", number, "!")
}
```

```{r}
numbers <- 1:10

# map returns a list the same length as numbers.
map(numbers, shout_number)
```
*** 

```{r}
#for (item in .x){
#  .f()
#}
```

## map() family of functions

The infixes influence the type of thing that is output:

```{r}
numbers <- 1:10

map_chr(numbers, shout_number)
```

## map() is nicer than apply()

```{r}
library(purrr)
numbers <- 1:10
map(numbers, shout_number)
```

## Another map() example

```{r}
calculate_sample_mean <- function(sample_size) {
  sample_mean <- mean(rnorm(sample_size))
  
  sample_mean
}

map_dbl(1:30, calculate_sample_mean)
```
This is doing the same work as our for-loop from last week.
