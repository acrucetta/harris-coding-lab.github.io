## Grouping data with `dplyr`

Often you want to repeat the same analysis across different subgroups. 
We can automate that with `group_by()`.

- summarize by group with `group_by()` + `summarize()` 
- created new columns with window functions `group_by()` + `mutate()` 
- `filter()` data with group specific matching criteria

## grouped summary with `group_by()` + `summarize()`  {.build}

![](images/02_groupby-summarize.png){#id .class width=80% height=80%}

## grouped summary with `group_by()` + `summarize()`  {.build}
Use case: You want summary statistics for certain subsets of the data.

```{r}
annual_housing_prices <- 
  texas_housing_data %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(total_sales = sum(sales, na.rm = TRUE),
            total_volume = sum(volume, na.rm = TRUE),
            mean_house_price = 
              total_volume / total_sales)
```

## How have Texas housing prices changed over time?
```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=3}
annual_housing_prices %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = mean_house_price)) + 
  geom_point()
```

## grouped summary with `group_by()` + `summarize()`

```{r}
texas_housing_data %>%
  group_by(city, year) %>%
  summarize(total_sales = sum(sales, na.rm = TRUE),
            total_volume = sum(volume, na.rm = TRUE),
            mean_house_price = 
              total_volume / total_sales)
```

## How have Texas housing prices changed over time in certain cities?
```{r, echo=FALSE}
texas_housing_data %>%
  group_by(city, year) %>%
  summarize(total_sales = sum(sales, na.rm = TRUE),
            total_volume = sum(volume, na.rm = TRUE),
            mean_house_price = 
              total_volume / total_sales) %>% 
  filter(city %in% c("Houston",  "Galveston")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = mean_house_price)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  facet_wrap(facets = "city", nrow = 2)
```

## What does `group_by()` do?

Let's make a grouped and non-grouped tibble for investigation.
```{r}
a_non_grouped_df <- 
  texas_housing_data %>% 
  select(city, year)
```

```{r}
a_grouped_df <- 
  texas_housing_data %>% 
    select(city, year) %>%
    group_by(city, year)
```

## What does `group_by()` do?
\footnotesize
```{r}
a_non_grouped_df %>% glimpse()
a_grouped_df %>% glimpse()
```


## What does `group_by()` do?


  - Conceptually, `group_by` "tags" rows as belong to a group. 
  - In practice, R creates a list of row numbers assigned to each group.
  
As an analyst, you just need to understand the concept. But to see what's going on ...  
\footnotesize
```{r}
# Recall, our "groups" are city-year combos
# and there are 12 months of obs per year
a_grouped_df %>% group_rows()
```

## Grouping columns have some restrictions

For example, you cannot remove them from the tibble
```{r}
a_grouped_df %>%
  select(-year)
```


## To get rid of groups, use `ungroup()`

```{r}
a_grouped_df %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(-year)
```


## grouped  `mutate`: differences

Use case: You want to work with differences. (Try running the code without `group_by()` and carefully compare the results.)

```{r}
# I'm going to use this a bunch, 
# so I'll store it in memory
july_texas_housing_data <-
  texas_housing_data %>%
    filter(month == 7) %>%
    select(city, year, sales) 

differenced_data <-
  july_texas_housing_data %>%
    group_by(city) %>%
    mutate(last_year_sales = lag(sales),
           delta_sales = sales - lag(sales))
```

## grouped  `mutate`: differences

Use case: You want to work with differences.^[`lag()`'s sibling is `lead()` which will give you data from the following year.]

```{r}
differenced_data %>% head(5)
```


## grouped  `mutate`: ranking

Use case: You want to rank sales within group. (Try running the code without `group_by()` and carefully compare the results.)


```{r}
ranked_data <-
july_texas_housing_data %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  mutate(sales_rank = rank(desc(sales))) 
```

## grouped  `mutate`: ranking

Use case: You want to rank sales within group.^[R has a variety of related functions see `?ranking`]

```{r}
ranked_data %>% arrange(year, sales_rank) %>% head(10)
```




## grouped  `filter`

Use case: You want to work with the top 10 cities for each year, you can 

```{r}
july_texas_housing_data %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  filter(rank(desc(sales)) <= 10) %>%
  arrange(year, sales)
```

##  `count()` is a useful short cut

Based on what you know about `texas_housing_data`. Can you tell what `count()` does?
```{r}
texas_housing_data %>%
  count(city, year) %>%
  head(5)
```

##  `count()` is a useful short cut
 
`count(x)` is nearly identical to `group_by(x) %>% summarize(n = n()) %>% ungroup()`.
 
```{r}
texas_housing_data %>%
  group_by(city, year) %>%
  summarize(n = n()) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  head(5)
```

##  `add_count()` is a useful short cut
 
`add_count(x)` is nearly identical to `group_by(x) %>% mutate(n = n()) %>% ungroup()`.
 
```{r}
texas_housing_data %>%
  select(city, year, sales) %>%
  add_count(city, year) %>%
  head(5)
```

##  `add_count()` is a useful short cut
 
`add_count(x)` is nearly identical to `group_by(x) %>% mutate(n = n()) %>% ungroup()`.
 
```{r}
texas_housing_data  %>%
  select(city, year, sales) %>%
  group_by(city, year) %>%
  mutate(n = n()) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  head(5)
```

## Recap: Analysis by group with `dplyr`

This lesson gave you an idea about how to:

- summarize data by group with `group_by()` + `summarize()` 
- created new columns with window functions `group_by()` + `mutate()` 
  - we saw `lag()` and `rank()`, but you could get 
    also add group-level stats like `mean()`
- `filter()` data with group specific matching criteria
- use `count()` and `add_count()` as short cuts for getting group level counts
