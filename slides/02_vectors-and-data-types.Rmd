library(tidyverse)
care_data <- tibble(
  id = 1:5,
  n_kids = c(2, 4, 0, 0, "Unknown"),

## Vectors^[Technically, I'm talking about "atomic vectors".]

Vectors are the foundational data structure in R.  

Here we will discuss how to:

- construct vectors and tibbles
- do vectorized math and computations
- deal with missing values
- work with vectors of different data types


## Vectors 

Vectors store an arbitrary^[Within limits determined by hardware] number of items of the same type. 

```{r}
# numeric vector of length 6
my_numbers <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)

# character vector of length 3
my_characters <- c("public", "policy", "101")
```

## Vectors 

In R, nearly every object you will work with is a vector
```{r}
# vectors of length 1
tis_a_vector <- 1919
technically_a_logical_vector <- TRUE
```

The `c()` function combines vectors
```{r}
c(c(1, 2, 3), c(4, 5, 6))
c(tis_a_vector, 1920)
```

## Creating vectors

There are some nice shortcuts for creating vectors.

```{r}
c("a", "a", "a", "a")
rep("a", 4)
```

Try out the following:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
rep(c("a", 5), 10)
rep(c("a", 5), each = 10)
```

## Creating vectors
There are also several ways to create vectors of sequential numbers:
```{r}
c(2, 3, 4, 5)
2:5
seq(2, 5)
```


## Creating random vectors

Create random data following a certain distribution
```{r}
(my_random_normals <- rnorm(5))
(my_random_uniforms <- runif(5))
```


## Creating empty vectors of a given type

Create empty vectors of a given type^[We'll discuss what types are soon.]
```{r}
# 1 million 0
my_integers <- integer(1e6)

# 40K ""
my_chrs <- character(4e5)
my_chrs[1:10]
```

## Binary operators are vectorized

We can do math with vectors!

```{r}
my_numbers <- 1:6

# this adds the vectors item by item
my_numbers + my_numbers 

# this adds 6 to each object  (called recycling)
my_numbers + 6 
```


## Binary operators are vectorized

We can do boolean logic with vectors!

```{r}
my_numbers <- 1:6

# c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) >  c(1, 1, 3, 3, pi, pi) 
# occurs item by item
my_numbers > c(1, 1, 3, 3, pi, pi)
```


## Binary operators are vectorized

We can do boolean logic with vectors!

```{r}
my_numbers <- 1:6
# behind the scenes 4 is recycled 
# to make c(4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4)
my_numbers > 4 
my_numbers == 3 
```


## Warning: Vector recycling

Be careful when operating with vectors. What's happening here?

```{r}
a <- 1:6 + 1:5
a
```

## Warning: Vector recycling

Be careful when operating with vectors. 
If they're different lengths, the shorter vector starts from it's beginnig (`6 + 1 = 7`).

```{r}

a <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) + c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
# 1 + 1, 
# 2 + 2, 
# 3 + 3, 
# 4 + 4, 
# 5 + 5, 
# !!!6 + 1!!! Recycled.
a
```


## Vectorized functions built into R

Some vectorized functions operate on each value in the vector and return a vector of the same length^[try it out yourself! use `?func` to learn more]

  - These are used with `mutate()`
  
```{r, eval = FALSE}
a_vector <- rnorm(100)
sqrt(a_vector) # take the square root of each number
log(a_vector) # take the natural log of each number
exp(a_vector) # e to the power of each number
round(a_vector, 2) # round each number

str_to_upper(a_chr_vector) # make each chr uppercase
str_replace(a_chr_vector, "e", "3")
```


## Functions that reduce vectors

Others take a vector and return a summary^[try it out yourself! use `?func` to learn more]

  - These are used with `summarize()`
  
```{r, eval=FALSE}
sum(a_vector)  # add all the numbers 
median(a_vector) # find the median
length(a_vector) # how long is the vector
any(a_vector > 1) # TRUE if any number in a_vector > 1

a_chr_vector <- c("a", "w", "e", "s", "o", "m", "e")
paste0(a_chr_vector) # combine strings
```


## Tibble columns are vectors

We can create tibbles manually 

- To test out code on a simpler tibble
- To organize data from a simulation

```{r}
care_data <- tibble(
  id = 1:5,
  n_kids = c(2, 4, 1, 1, NA),
  child_care_costs = c(1000, 3000, 300, 300, 500),
  random_noise = rnorm(5, sd = 5)*30
)
```

## Subsetting

Three ways to pull out a column as a vector.^[See Appendix for more on subsetting]


```{r}
# tidy way
care_data %>% pull(n_kids)

# base R way
care_data$n_kids
# base R way
care_data[["n_kids"]]
```

## Subsetting

Two ways to pull out a column as a tibble

```{r}
# tidy way
care_data %>% select(n_kids)

# base R way
care_data["n_kids"]
```


## Type issues

Sometimes you load a data set, write code that makes sense and get an error like this:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
care_data %>% 
  mutate(spending_per_child = n_kids / child_care_costs)
```
`Error in n_kids/child_care_costs : non-numeric argument to binary operator`

## Type issues
```{r}
glimpse(care_data)
```

## Data types
R has four primary types of atomic vectors 
  
  - these determine how R stores the data (technical)

## Data types

Focusing on the types, we have:

```{r}
# logical, also known as booleans
type_logical <- FALSE
type_logical <- TRUE

# integer and double, together are called: numeric
type_integer <- 1L
type_double <- 1.0

type_character <- "abbreviated as chr" 
type_character <- "also known as a string"
```

## Testing types

```{r}
a <- "1"
typeof(a)
is.integer(a)
is.character(a)
```

## Testing types

In our example:
```{r}
typeof(care_data$child_care_costs)
typeof(care_data$n_kids)
```

## Type coercion 

The error we got when we tried `a + b` was because `a` is a character. We can reassign types on the fly:
```{r}
a <- "4"
as.integer(a) + 3
as.numeric(a) + 3
```

## Type coercion

To address our problem, we use `mutate()` and `as.integer()` to change the type of `n_kids`
```{r}
care_data %>%
  mutate( n_kids = as.integer(n_kids),
          spending_per_kid = child_care_costs / n_kids)
```


## NAs introduced by coercion

The code produces a warning! Why? R does not know how to turn the string "unknown" into an integer. So, it uses `NA` which is how R represents missing or unknown values. 

```{r}
as.integer("Unknown")
```

## `NA`s are contagious

```{r}
NA + 4
max(c(NA, 4, 1000))
```

## Automatic coercion (Extension material to be discussed live)

Some type coercion is done by R automatically:
```{r}
# paste0() is a function that combines two chr into one
paste0("str", "ing")
paste0(1L, "ing")
```

`1L` is an `int`, but R will coerce it into a `chr` in this context.

## Automatic coercion

Logicals are coercible to numeric or character. This is very useful!

What do you think the following code will return?
```{r, eval=FALSE}
TRUE + 4
FALSE + 4
paste0(FALSE, "?")
mean(c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE))
```

## Automatic coercion
```{r, eval=TRUE}
TRUE + 4
FALSE + 4
paste0(FALSE, "?")
mean(c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE))
```



## `NA`s are contagious, redux.

```{r}
b <- c(NA, 3, 4, 5)
sum(b)
```

## `NA`s are contagious, redux.

Often, we can tell R to ignore the missing values. 

```{r}
b <- c(NA, 3, 4, 5)
sum(b, na.rm = TRUE)
```

## Subsetting vectors

Use `[[` for subsetting a single value
```{r}
# letters is built into R and has lower case letters from the alphabet
# get the third letter in the alphabet
letters[[3]]
```

Use `[` for subsetting multiple values
```{r}
# get the 25th, 5th and 19th letters in the alphabet
letters[c(25,5,19)]
```

## Subsetting vectors 

Using a negative sign, allows subsetting everything except th

```{r}
my_numbers <- c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10)
# get all numbers besides the 1st 
my_numbers[-1]
# get all numbers besides the 1st and second
my_numbers[-c(1,2)]
```

 We can also subset with booleans
```{r}
# get all numbers where true
my_numbers[c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)]
my_numbers[my_numbers > 4]
```


## Subsetting recommendations

I recommend sticking with the tidy version when working with tibbles and data. 

- Tidyverse functions will cover nearly all of your data processing needs.
- The `[` and `[[` subsetting have a lot of subtle and unexpected behavior.
- If you find yourself doing "programming"" in R then it is worth revisiting subsetting in `adv-r`


## Example: Using vectors to calculate a sum of fractions {.exercise}

Use R to calculate the sum 

$$\sum_{n=0}^{10} \frac{1}{2^n}$$

How would you translate this into code?

## Example:  Using vectors to calculate a sum of fractions 

We go from math notation $$\sum_{n=0}^{10} \frac{1}{2^n}$$ to R code:

```{r warning=FALSE}
numerators <- rep(1, 11)
denominators <- 2 ^ c(0:10)

sum(numerators/denominators)

```

## Recap: Vectors and data types

We discussed how to:

- Create vectors and tibbles for various circumstances
- Do vectorize operations and math with vectors (we implicitly did this with `mutate`)
- Subset tibbles (we explicitly did this with `select` and `filter`)
- Understand data types and use type coercion when necessary.

## Technical note: Atomic vectors vs lists

- Atomic vectors have a single type.
- Lists can hold data of multiple types.^[This is beyond our scope, but lists can be thought of as a vector of pointers. The interested student can read more at https://adv-r.hadley.nz/]

![](images/summary-tree.png)

## Technical note: a Lists holding multiple types.

```{r}
a_list <- list(1L, "fun", c(1,2,3))
typeof(a_list)
typeof(a_list[[1]])
typeof(a_list[[2]])
typeof(a_list[[3]])
```
