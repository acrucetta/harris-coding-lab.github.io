```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(haven)
mrc_data <- read_dta("data/mrc_table10.dta")
```


We expect you to watch the `class 3` material, [here](harris-coding-lab.github.io) prior to lab. Download the data before lab.


## Data:

For this lab, we will use data from Opportunity Insights: https://opportunityinsights.org/data/ 

1. Download the Stata file and Readme for "College Level Characteristics from the IPEDS Database and the College Scorecard".


## Intro to `Rmd`s

1. Create an `Rmd` file. (In RStudio's menu `File > New File > R Markdown`). Name the document and select PDF. These settings can be changed later.
2. Save the `Rmd` in your coding lab folder as `lab_3.Rmd`. 
3. New `Rmd`s comes with some example code. Read the document and then knit to pdf by clicking the knit button. If `pdf` doesn't work, try `html`. 
  
      ![](images/01_knit.jpeg){width=30%}
      
      Pay attention to the syntax and ask your group or TA about anything you don't understand. `Rmd`s start with meta information which provides instructions to `knitr` on how to knit. After that, there's a normal code chunk which runs, but you won't see because they of the `include=FALSE` bit at start of the code chunk. 
      
      ![](images/01_top_of_rmd.jpeg){width=40%}
    
    Keep the part shown in the image above and erase the rest of the code and text in the document. This is how we start our own `Rmd` code.

4. Make a new code chunk by pressing Ctrl + Alt + I ( Cmd + Option + I on macOS).^[You can also type three tick marks with `{r}` and then another three tick marks. ] Then, add code to load the `tidyverse` in that chunk.

5. `Rmd`s keep track of their own working directories. Try `getwd()` in your `Rmd`^[By which, I mean in a code chunk in your `Rmd`.] and then run it again in the console. You should notice that `R` in the console uses your default working directory. On the other hand, the `lab_3.Rmd` knows which folder it is in and uses that folder as the working directory! 

6. If you didn't already, put the data you downloaded in your preferred data location. 

If you followed the set-up from above, you should be able to read the data in your `Rmd` with no error. 


We provide three options dependening on how you have structured your folders. Option 1 is the easiest for a first time user. Keep the data in the same folder as the Rmd. Option 2 and 3 are what you're more likely to see in a professional environment.^[We did a poll among the TAs about their preferred directory structure. We were split between Option 2, Option 3, and a feeling like the choice was "Too personal" to make a cohort wide ]

<!-- Note to Reviewer ... This might be too much ... what do you think?-->

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(haven)
# Option 1:
# data is in the same folder as Rmd
mrc_data <- read_dta("mrc_table10.dta")

# Option 2:
# data is in a data folder inside the folder with the Rmd 
mrc_data <- read_dta("data/mrc_table10.dta")

# Option 3:
# data is in a data folder that is at the same level 
# as the folder with the Rmd.
mrc_data <- read_dta("../data/mrc_table10.dta")
```

Once you got the data to load with code in the Rmd. Try the same code in the console. It will throw an error. Briefly discuss why with your group.



## Warm-up: Conditional statements and `ifelse`:

1. Without running the code, predict what the output will be. Then, see if you were right by running the code in the console.

**True or False**

  a. `TRUE | FALSE`
  b. `TRUE | (FALSE & FALSE)`
  c. `TRUE | (10 < 4)`
  d. `TRUE | (10 < 4 & )`
  e. `TRUE | (4 > pi & 3 < pi & exp(1) >= 3 & 1e6 < 2^30)`
  f. `4 > 2 | 2 > 4`
  g. What rule do these problems demonstrate?
  
*Solution*
  a. `TRUE`
  b. `TRUE`
  c. `TRUE`
  d. `Error, (10 < 4 & ) is an incomplete statement`
  e. `TRUE`
  f. `TRUE`
  g. OR (`|`) returns `TRUE` if at least one term is `TRUE`
  
**True and False**

  a. `TRUE & FALSE`
  b. `TRUE & (FALSE & FALSE)`
  c. `TRUE & (10 < 4)`
  d. `TRUE & (10 < 4 & )`
  e. `TRUE & (4 > pi & 3 < pi & exp(1) >= 3 & 1e6 < 2^30)`
  f. `4 > 2 & 2 > 4`
  g. What rule do these problems demonstrate?

*Solution*
  a. `FALSE`
  b. `FALSE`
  c. `FALSE`
  d. `Error, (10 < 4 & ) is an incomplete statement`
  e. `FALSE`
  f. `FALSE`
  g. AND (`&`) returns `TRUE` *only* when *both* operands are `TRUE`
  
**True and NA**
  
1. There are a few times when `NA` are not contangious. Run the code and think about how this relates to your findings above.
      
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    TRUE & NA    
    FALSE & NA    
    TRUE | NA    
    FALSE | NA    
    ```

*Solution*
```{r}
TRUE & NA     
FALSE & NA    
TRUE | NA    
FALSE | NA    
```
`NA` is valid logical object, and the results of statements including `NA` will evaluate to `NA` when the outcome is ambiguous. Think of `NA` as an *unknown*.

`TRUE & NA` evaluates to `NA` because we do not know if `NA` represents a `TRUE` or `FALSE` statements, so the outcome is ambiguous. If `NA` were a `TRUE` statement, then this example would evaluate to `TRUE`. If `NA` were a `FALSE` statement, then this example would evaluate to `FALSE`.

`FALSE & NA` evaluates to `FALSE` because at least one of the statements is `FALSE`.

`TRUE | NA` evaluates to `TRUE` because at least one of the statements is `TRUE`.

`FALSE | NA` evaluates to `NA` again because we do not know if `NA` represents a `TRUE` or `FALSE` statements, so the outcome is ambiguous. If `NA` were a `TRUE` statement, then this example would evaluate to `TRUE`. If `NA` were a `FALSE` statement, then this example would evaluate to `FALSE`.

2. Without running the code, predict what the output will be. Then, see if you were right by running the code in the console.

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    ifelse(TRUE, "yes", "no")
    ifelse(FALSE, "yes", "no")
    ifelse(c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE), "yes", "no")
    ifelse(c(TRUE & FALSE, 
             FALSE | TRUE, 
             TRUE | TRUE, 
             FALSE & FALSE), 
           "yes", "no")
    ifelse(c(NA, TRUE, FALSE), "yes", "no")
    ifelse(c(NA, NA, TRUE, FALSE), "yes", "no")
    ```

*Solution*
```{r, eval = TRUE}
ifelse(TRUE, "yes", "no")
ifelse(FALSE, "yes", "no")
ifelse(c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE), "yes", "no")
ifelse(c(TRUE & FALSE, 
         FALSE | TRUE, 
         TRUE | TRUE, 
         FALSE & FALSE), 
         "yes", "no")
ifelse(c(NA, TRUE, FALSE), "yes", "no")
ifelse(c(NA, NA, TRUE, FALSE), "yes", "no")
```

Recall that `ifelse()` asks, "Does the statement in the first position evaluate to `TRUE`?" If it does, then return what sits in the second position. If it does not, then return what sits in the third position. As always, `NA` will be returned if the outcome of a statement is ambiguous.

If what sits in the first position is a vector, then repeat this process for every element of the vector one by one.

## Common uses of `ifelse`


1. Run the following code and you will see the distinct `tier_names` available in the dataset.

    ```{r, eval=FALSE}
    mrc_data %>% distinct(tier_name)
    ```
    a. `ifelse` can be used to adjust entries in the `tier_name` column. Change "Two-year (public and private not-for-profit)"
        to "Two-year (public and private)".^[Hint: In the first position, put a condition testing if `tier_name` matches the string. If it does, we replace the string with "Two-year (public and private)", otherwise keep the same data.] 
        
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    # Fill in the ... with the appropriate code
    mrc_data %>%
      mutate(tier_name = ifelse( ... , ..., tier_name))
    ```
    
*Solution*
```{r}
mrc_data %>%
  mutate(tier_name = ifelse(
            tier_name == "Two-year (public and private not-for-profit)",
            "Two-year (public and private)", 
            tier_name)) %>% 
  distinct(tier_name)
```
Notice that a good way to check if you've executed this correctly, is to call `distinct()` once again and see for yourself if "Two-year (public and private not-for-profit)" is still a value for `tier_name`.

    b. `ifelse` is often used to collapse tiers. Redefine `tier_name` so that "Nonselective four-year public" and "Nonselective four-year private not-for-profit" are grouped together as "Nonselective four-year (public and private)".^[Hint: The code will be very similar to the previous problem.]
    
*Solution*
```{r}
mrc_data %>%
  mutate(tier_name = ifelse(
            tier_name == "Nonselective four-year public" | 
            tier_name == "Nonselective four-year private not-for-profit",
            "Nonselective four-year (public and private)", 
            tier_name)) %>% 
  distinct(tier_name)
```

2. As you can see, there are 1466 colleges missing average SAT scores. Sometimes we want to replace `NA`s with a value. For example, linear regressions will drop any row with `NA`s, and we might not want that.^[I believe you'll discuss missing data problems in stats I.] 

    ```{r}
    mrc_data %>%
      summarise(missing_sat_2013 = sum(is.na(sat_avg_2013)))
    ```
To avoid dropping rows, sometimes people replace the `NA` with the mean and add a new column that is an indicator of missingness. Using `mutate()` and `ifelse()`, fill `NA` in `sat_avg_2013` with the average SAT score of the other colleges and create a column called `missing_sat_avg_2013` that is 1 if `NA` and 0 otherwise.^[Hint: First, make the indicator column.  Hint 2: When replacing `NA`  in the example, I used the following code to find the mean `mean(fake_data, na.rm = TRUE)`.]

Here's a small example of what we expect. Try reproducing this example and then applying your code to `mrc_data`.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
before <- tibble(fake_data = c(1, 2, NA))
after <- before %>% mutate(missing_fake_data = ifelse(is.na(fake_data), 1, 0),
                           fake_data = ifelse(is.na(fake_data), mean(fake_data, na.rm = TRUE), fake_data))
```
```{r}
before <- tibble(fake_data = c(1, 2, NA))
before
after
```

*Solution*
```{r}
mrc_data <- mrc_data %>%
  mutate(missing_sat_avg_2013 = ifelse(
           is.na(sat_avg_2013), 1, 0),
         sat_avg_2013 = ifelse(
           is.na(sat_avg_2013),
           mean(sat_avg_2013, na.rm = TRUE),
           sat_avg_2013))

mrc_data %>%
  summarise(sum(is.na(sat_avg_2013)),
            sum(missing_sat_avg_2013),
            sum(sat_avg_2013 == mean(sat_avg_2013, na.rm = TRUE)))
```
To check your work, you can use summarize() again. We see the following. There are no more `NA` values in the `sat_avg_2013` column. There are 1466 instances of a value `1` in `missing_sat_avg_2013`, which matches the number of `NA` values were originally present in `sat_avg_2013`. There at 1466 instances of `sat_avg_2013` equalling the mean of `sat_avg_2013`, so we can feel fairly confident that `NA` values were replaced by the mean.
```{r}
mrc_data %>%
      summarise(missing_sat_2013 = sum(is.na(sat_avg_2013)))
```

##  Extension: College choice:

This part is admittedly silly! Imagine the situation: It's 2014 and a group of high school friends want to go to college together. They need to find a college that meets all their preferences. Your job is to find the perfect college.

| Name | SAT Score | Preferences|
| --- | --- | ------ | 
| A-plus Abdul | 1430 | Either ivy plus tier or a flagship school |
| Snooty Stephen | 1450 | not a public school |
| Nourishing Nancy | 1590 | school in the midwest so she can be near her grandma |
| Radical Rei | 1490 | strong social studies (as measured by the percentage of students majoring in social studies  > 30 percent) | 
| Cost-conscious Casey | 1600 | wants a public school in CA or a school where students from homes in the bottom 20th percentile of incomes pay less than 10000 per year|

Here are the rules. They want to go to school where their test scores are within 100 points of the school average SAT score. To match their preferences, use the most recent data. You will need a few tools.

1. First, in order to understand what a column contains you can use `distinct()`^[from `dplyr`. The codebook is also useful.]. For example, say you are trying to figure out how to identify "ivy plus" schools (or what that specifically means). Using `names()` you see their is a columns called  `tier_name`.

    ```{r}
    mrc_data %>% distinct(tier_name)    
    ```
    We see there are 12 tiers and one is "Ivy Plus"! Note the capitalization.
    
2. Second, we're going to have to find schools that match ranges of SAT scores. Welcome `between()`.^[from `dplyr`] 

  
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    mrc_data %>% filter(1330 <= sat_avg_2013, sat_avg_2013 <= 1530)
    mrc_data %>% filter(between(sat_avg_2013, 1330, 1530))
    ```

    a. Figure out whether `between()` use `<` or `<=`? 
  
*Solution*

As always, `?between` is the first thing to do. In the R Documentation, you should see "This is a shortcut for x >= left & x <= right, implemented efficiently in ..."
```{r, eval=F}
?between
```

You can also test things out in R. In this case, we see that the lower bound (1330) is included in the final output. However, this way would not be helpful to tell whether `between()` use `<` or `<=` if there is no 1330 entry in the data.
```{r}
mrc_data %>% 
  filter(between(sat_avg_2013, 1330, 1530)) %>%
  summarize(min(sat_avg_2013),
            max(sat_avg_2013))
```

3. The final thing is a concept. You're probably about to write code that looks like the following pseudo code.^[pseudo code is a term for fake code that captures the logic of some coding idea without being actual code.]

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    # This is pseudo code 
    mrc_data %>%
      mutate(abdul_choices = ifelse(CONDITIONS, yes, no),
             stephens_choices = ifelse(CONDITIONS, yes, no),
             ...) %>%
      filter(abdul_choices == yes, stephens_choices == yes, ...)
    ```

    We can avoid the extra `== yes` by making `abdul_choices` a logical vector. In other words, write code like so:
    
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    # This is pseudo code 
    mrc_data %>%
      mutate(abdul_choices = ifelse(CONDITIONS, TRUE, FALSE),
             stephens_choices = ifelse(CONDITIONS, TRUE, FALSE),
             ...) %>%
      filter(abdul_choices, stephens_choices, ...)
    ```


    b. Test out the concept with a simple example.^[For example, try it with Abdul's only condition being Ivy Plus.] 

*Solution*
```{r}
mrc_data %>%
  mutate(abdul_choices = ifelse(
            tier_name == "Ivy Plus", TRUE, FALSE)) %>%
  filter(abdul_choices) %>%   
  select(name,tier_name,abdul_choices,sat_avg_2013,flagship)
```

4. Now you're ready to find the college for the five friends.

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    # fill in the  ... with appropriate code
    
    # We'll give this a name so we can use it later.
    bff_super_awesome_college_list <- 
    mrc %>%
      mutate(abdul_choices   = ifelse(between(sat_avg_2013, 1330, 1530) & 
                                    (tier_name == "Ivy Plus" | ... ), TRUE, FALSE),
             stephen_choices = ifelse(..., ..., ...), 
             nancy_choices   = ifelse(..., ..., ...),
             rei_choices     = ifelse(..., ..., ...),
             casey_choices   = ifelse(..., ..., ...)
             ) 
      
    
    bff_super_awesome_college_list %>%
      filter(abdul_choices, sam_choices, nancy_choices, rei_choices, casey_choices)
    ```

*Solution*
```{r, eval = T, echo = T}
bff_super_awesome_college_list <- mrc_data %>%
  mutate(abdul   = ifelse(between(sat_avg_2013, 1330, 1530) & 
                           (tier_name == "Ivy Plus" | flagship == 1),
                          TRUE, FALSE),
         stephen = ifelse(between(sat_avg_2013, 1350, 1550) & public == 0,
                          TRUE, FALSE),
         nancy   = ifelse(between(sat_avg_2013, 1490, 1690) & region == 2,
                          TRUE, FALSE),
         rei     = ifelse(between(sat_avg_2013, 1390, 1590) & pct_socialscience_2000 > 30, 
                          TRUE, FALSE),
         casey   = ifelse(between(sat_avg_2013, 1500, 1600) &
                           (public == 1 & state == "CA" | scorecard_netprice_2013 < 10000),
                          TRUE, FALSE))
```

  c. What school(s) are acceptable to all five 
  
*Solution*
```{r}
bff_super_awesome_college_list %>%
  filter(abdul, stephen, nancy, rei, casey) %>% 
  select(name,abdul, stephen, nancy, rei, casey)
```

```{r,eval=T}
# Alternative (notice it yields the same result)
bff_super_awesome_college_list %>%
  filter(abdul & stephen & nancy & rei & casey) %>% 
  select(name,abdul, stephen, nancy, rei, casey)
```

  d. How many school(s) are available to any of the five. Adjust `filter` statement slightly.^[Hint: Think about the warm-up you did for this lab]

*Solution*
```{r}
bff_super_awesome_college_list %>%
  filter(abdul | stephen | nancy | rei | casey) %>%
  nrow()
```

5. The five friends have `NA` in their choice sets. Do the the school list change if we replace all the `NA`s with `TRUE`? Without coding, argue why the list will not change if we replace the `NA`s with `FALSE`.

*Solution*
Yes, the school list will change if we replace all `NA`s with `TRUE`. The list will not change if we replace `NA`s with `FALSE` since we are using the OR (|) operator, and this operator evaluates to `TRUE` so long as at least one statement is `TRUE`.

6. **Challenge** Create a "Five friends college ranking". A college is ranked 1 if it is acceptable to all 5 friends. 2 if it is acceptable to any 4 friends and so on.^[3 if it is acceptable to 3 friends. 4 if acceptable to 2 friends and 5 if acceptable to 1 friend] Colleges that are not acceptable to any friend should be marked "Unranked".

*Solution 1*

We take advantage of the fact that the arithmetic  operation of booleans (`TRUE` and `FALSE`) works like 1's and 0's. Since `abdul`, `stephen`, `nancy`, `rei`, and `casey` are logical vectors (vectors full of `TRUE`s and `FALSE`s), we get the number of friends who would accept going to that school when we add across the rows which represent schools. Finally, we use `case_when` to assign the rankings according to how many friends would accept going to that school.

```{r}
bff_super_awesome_college_list %>%
  mutate(num_friends_accept = abdul + stephen + nancy + rei + casey,
         rank = case_when(num_friends_accept == 5 ~ "1",
                          num_friends_accept == 4 ~ "2",
                          num_friends_accept == 3 ~ "3",
                          num_friends_accept == 2 ~ "4",
                          num_friends_accept == 1 ~ "5",
                          num_friends_accept == 0 ~ "Unranked")) %>%
  arrange(rank) %>%
  select(name, num_friends_accept, rank)
```


*Solution 2*

Listing all the possible cases can be mundane when the number of cases is very large. There are two functions that can be very helpful for this exercise: `recode()` and `dense_rank()`. If you are not sure what is going on in the `mutate()` step, please see the simple example provided below. 
```{r}
bff_super_awesome_college_list %>%
  mutate(num_friends_accept = abdul + stephen + nancy + rei + casey,
         rank = recode(as.character(dense_rank(-num_friends_accept)),"6" = "Unranked")) %>% 
  arrange(rank) %>%
  select(name, num_friends_accept, rank)
```

*Simple example*

`dense_rank()` in dplyr can give you continuous ranks.
```{r}
simple.example <- c(5,2,1,4,3)
dense_rank(simple.example)
```

This is a common trick to obtain the descending ranks.
```{r}
dense_rank(-simple.example)
```

What if we want to label the last rank (which is 5 in this case) with "Last"? In the lecture, Ari has showed your an example where R cannot handle "numeric" and "character" type entries in the same column. To update the label with characters, let's first convert the numeric ranks into characters.
```{r}
simple.rank <- as.character(dense_rank(-simple.example))
```

Finally, let's relabel `5` with `"Last"`. N.B. There are many other ways to do so.
```{r}
recode(simple.rank, "5"="Last")
```
