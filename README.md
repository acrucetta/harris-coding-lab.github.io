## PPHA 31002 Statistics for Data Analysis I: Coding Lab

This website (harris-coding-lab.github.io) contains the content for the 5-week Stats I Coding Lab accompanying PPHA 31002. The course is taught during Fall Quarter 2019 for students of Harris Public Policy School at the University of Chicago. The workshop aims to introduce R programming concepts including basic syntax, operators, reading files, dataframes and calculations, if statements, loops, and functions.

### Schedule 

The Coding Lab will be offered at the following times during the first five weeks of the quarter:



 Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday 
--|--|--|--|--
 5 - 6:20pm| 5 - 6:20pm| 5 - 6:20pm| 5 - 6:20pm| 9:30 - 10:50am & 11:00 - 12:20 pm
 KC0001 | KC1002	| KC1002|	KC1022	|KC0001	
 
### Prerequisites

We ask that Coding Lab attendees have R and RStudio pre-installed on their local machine. If you need help getting set up, please visit the R Bar at Harris for assistance with installation.
