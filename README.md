## Summer and Fall Coding Lab

This website (harris-coding-lab.github.io) contains the content for the Harris School's Summer and Fall Coding Labs. The workshop aims to introduce R programming concepts with a focus on preparing and analyzing data, and conducting statistical simulations. We will cover how to read data into R,  manipulate data with a suite of tools from the `tidyverse` package `dplyr`. We will also discuss some basic programming concepts including data types, operators, control flow with if statements and for loops, and how to write your own functions.

### Schedule 

### Prerequisites

We ask that Coding Lab attendees have R and RStudio pre-installed on their local machine. If you need help getting set up, please visit the R Bar at Harris for assistance with installation. ... INSERT INFO FROM JEN / FAY

The first three weeks of fall coding lab covers the same material (minus `ggplot`). Week 4 and 5 cover new material on for loops and functions. 
Accelerated fall coding lab consists solely of new material on for loops and functions.
