## Summer and Fall Coding Lab

This website (harris-coding-lab.github.io) contains the content for the Harris School's Summer and Fall Coding Labs. The workshop aims to introduce R programming concepts with a focus on preparing and analyzing data, and conducting statistical simulations. We will cover how to read data into R,  manipulate data with a suite of tools from the `tidyverse` package `dplyr`. We will also discuss some basic programming concepts including data types, operators, control flow with if statements and for loops, and how to write your own functions.

### Prerequisites

We ask that Coding Lab attendees have the latest stable versions of [R](https://cloud.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) pre-installed on their local machine. If you need help getting set up, Harris IT is hosting office hours during on Sept 1 and 2 (you should have an email with the details.) and you can email the amazing staff of Harris IT at hsit-servicedesk@uchicago.edu. 

### Summer Lab Materials

Links to materials for each week's workshop will be posted here as provided.

The first three weeks of fall coding lab covers the same material (minus `ggplot`).
Week 4 and 5 cover new material on for loops and functions.
Accelerated fall coding lab consists solely of new material on for loops and functions.


### [Final Project](lab/project_description.pdf)

Your [final project](lab/project_description.pdf) is quite simple. You will pick a data set that speaks to you and try to uncover something interesting which you will visualize in a plot. You will also compute some summary statistics that you will show in a summary table. Your TAs will review your work and provide a non-binding suggestion as to whether you are ready for the 'accelerated' Fall Coding Lab. Click on the link for details.

### Additional Resources
- **R Bar**: Harris-provided support for R-related issues. 
- [tidyverse cheetsheets](https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) start with `dplyr` and `ggplot` 
- [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/): free online book with clear explanations of many `tidyverse` functions, the book to read on data analysis with R
- [DataQuest.io](https://www.dataquest.io): online modules about specific programming concepts, access provided by Harris. For students who would like additional guided practice we recommend:
  - **Vectors**
    - [introduction to programming in r](https://app.dataquest.io/m/332/introduction-to-programming-in-r)
    - [working with vectors](https://app.dataquest.io/m/333/working-with-vectors)

  - **Data frames**
    - [working with data frames](https://app.dataquest.io/m/336/working-with-data-frames/)
    - [dplyr to investigate frequency distributions of data](https://app.dataquest.io/m/396/frequency-distributions)
  - **Control flow and if statements**
    - [control flow](https://app.dataquest.io/m/338/working-with-control-structures)
  - **Functions**
    - [writing custom functions](https://app.dataquest.io/m/340/writing-custom-functions)
    - [working with functionals](https://app.dataquest.io/m/341/working-with-functionals) (includes discussion of map)
  - **Extensions**

     - [`gather()` and correlations](https://app.dataquest.io/m/325/correlations-and-reshaping-data/4/gathering-data-into-columns)
       - "step 2" is all about `ggplot` and potentially useful.
  - They're always adding content, so we probably missed some good ones.
